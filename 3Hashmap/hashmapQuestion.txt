Code : Maximum Frequency Number
Send Feedback
You are given an array of integers that contain numbers in random order. Write a program to find and return the number which occurs the maximum times in the given input.
If two or more elements contend for the maximum frequency, return the element which occurs in the array first.
Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of the size of the array. Let us denote it with the symbol N.
The following line contains N space separated integers, that denote the value of the elements of the array.
Output Format :
The first and only line of output contains most frequent element in the given array.
Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^8

Code : Print Intersection
Send Feedback
You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.
Note :
Input arrays/lists can contain duplicate elements.

The intersection elements printed would be in the order they appear in the first sorted array/list(ARR1).


Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case or query contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the first array/list.

The second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements of the first the array/list.

The third line contains an integer 'M' representing the size of the second array/list.

The fourth line contains 'M' single space separated integers representing the elements of the second array/list.
Output format :
For each test case, print the intersection elements in a row, separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= M <= 10^6

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 2 :

2 6 1 2
5
1 2 3 4 2
Sample Output 2 :
1 2 2
Explanation for Sample Output 2 :
Since, both input arrays have two '2's, the intersection of the arrays also have two '2's. The first '2' of first array matches with the first '2' of the second array.
Similarly, the second '2' of the first array matches with the second '2' if the second array.

Given a random integer array A of size N. Find and print the count of pair of elements in the array which sum up to 0.
Note: Array A can contain duplicate elements as well.
Input format:
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of the size of the array. Let us denote it with the symbol N.
The following line contains N space separated integers, that denote the value of the elements of the array.
Output format :
The first and only line of output contains the count of pair of elements in the array which sum up to 0. 
Constraints :
0 <= N <= 10^4
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:

Longest Consecutive Sequence
Send Feedback
You are given an array of unique integers that contain numbers in random order. You have to find the longest possible sequence of consecutive numbers using the numbers from given array.
You need to return the output array which contains starting and ending element. If the length of the longest possible sequence is one, then the output array must contain only single element.
Note:
1. Best solution takes O(n) time.
2. If two sequences are of equal length, then return the sequence starting with the number whose occurrence is earlier in the array.
Input format:
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of the size of the array. Let us denote it with the symbol n.
The following line contains n space separated integers, that denote the value of the elements of the array.
Output format:
The first and only line of output contains starting and ending element of the longest consecutive sequence. If the length of longest consecutive sequence, then just print the starting element.
Constraints :
0 <= n <= 10^6
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
13
2 12 9 16 10 5 3 20 25 11 1 8 6 
Sample Output 1 :
8 12 
Sample Input 2 :
7
3 7 2 1 9 8 41
Sample Output 2 :
7 9
Explanation: Sequence should be of consecutive numbers. Here we have 2 sequences with same length i.e. [1, 2, 3] and [7, 8, 9], but we should select [7, 8, 9] because the starting point of [7, 8, 9] comes first in input array and therefore, the output will be 7 9, as we have to print starting and ending element of the longest consecutive sequence.
Sample Input 3 :
7
15 24 23 12 19 11 16
Sample Output 3 :
15 16
